  <p>My goal is to empower people, give them the power to achieve their dreams and have a growth mindset, by improving the material they consume and the process in which they learn. If I can make people's lives better than I am happy.</p>

  <h2>Here's what people have said about my work...</h3>

  <div class="message">
    I really like this course!!! I would rank this course in the top three of all courses that I've taken. Ryan is very knowledgeable and has keen insight on HTML and CSS. I also found the instructor easy to follow and understand. Gr8 course, Ryan. Keep up the AWESOME work my friend!!!

    Dude... thank you so much. I landed a guest research position with professor BJ Fogg at Stanford using your techniques. I implemented your strategy and just started seeing the world in a different way. Before, I hid behind my computer screen. Now, I focus much more on being friends and helping people. My quality of life has increased by roughly 1,000%.

    Possibly the best HTML/CSS course! Of the several HTML/CSS courses I've been working through, Ryan's easily ranks as one of the best. It isn't perfect, as nothing is perfect, but Ryan backs up his claim of truly understanding how one ought to teach. Anyone can be intimidated when learning new technologies, including me, and Ryan puts you at ease throughout the course.

    Cameron and Ryan you guys rock! Usually webinars are jam-packed with salesy techniques, which yours had some but I really appreciated the time you took to actually give value with your demonstration as well as sitting around for another hour after to answer all of our questions. I'm sold!
