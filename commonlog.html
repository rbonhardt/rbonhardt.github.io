His earliest essays were little more than compilations of these thoughts." I agree.</p>

		<h2>On Play</h2>
		<blockquote>It should be noted that children at play are not playing about; their games should be seen as their most serious-minded activity. --Michele de Montaigne</blockquote>
		<h2>On Sales</h2>
		<blockquote>The next time you really want someone to understand, buy what you are selling or be convinced of your opinion figure out how you can show them vs tell them. – Noah Kagan</blockquote>
