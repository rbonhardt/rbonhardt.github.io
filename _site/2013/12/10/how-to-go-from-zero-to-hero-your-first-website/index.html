<p>Instead of taking the time to learn each – html, css, and javascript – in their entirety I would have attacked it along the guidelines of&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591845556/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1591845556&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=iampla-20">“The First 20 Hours”</a>.&nbsp; So here’s to you, person excited and scared to jump into the world of &nbsp;front-end&nbsp;web development:</p><p><em>Note: In case you're confused, front-end is everything you see as a visitor to the site (HTML is the structure, CSS is the style). &nbsp;The more complicated stuff is the back-end - stuff behind the scenes - which is the functionality. &nbsp;For now don't worry about any of that.</em></p><h2><strong>First off, what do you want to be able to do? Be specific.</strong></h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Answer this question so you have a measuring stick and goal in mind.&nbsp; With this goal you will be more inclined to work towards it and know when you have achieved it.</p><p><strong>Are you trying to learn because you have a business idea and want to test it?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>If its just one item (ebook idea, service, ecourse) then use&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://unbounce.com/">unbounce</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.instapage.com/">instapage</a>&nbsp;to create your site (which is actually just a page) – no coding necessary ; you’d just be wasting hours when you could skip to testing your business idea.&nbsp; To accept payments on those sites you can use the simple, new and fastly-growing&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://gumroad.com/">gumroad</a>&nbsp;(great for digital goods, not physical….yet), the old standard&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.paypal.com/home">paypal</a>&nbsp;or one of my favorites&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.wepay.com/">wepay</a>.</p><p>But if you’re in this category&nbsp;<strong>STOP.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Here’s a hint on how to avoid losing $15,000 on your first business idea like I did.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>TEST YOUR IDEA FIRST.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Before you jump in creating a website, buying product, business cards, tshirts, trademarks, web hosting and taking hours to set up your business.&nbsp;<strong>STOP</strong></p><p><strong>Take a couple dollars and couple hours and check out one or two of the following:</strong></p><ol><li><strong><a target="_blank" href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2011/09/24/how-to-create-a-million-dollar-business-this-weekend-examples-appsumo-mint-chihuahuas/">How to Create a Million-Dollar Business This Weekend</a>:&nbsp;</strong>a quick blog post that will get you in the mindset of testing your idea first.</li><li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.appsumo.com/how-to-make-your-first-dollar/"><strong>How to Make your First Dollar</strong></a><strong>:&nbsp;</strong>course from the guys at AppSumo on how to test your business ideas and get your first dollar. &nbsp;QUALITY. &nbsp;If you don't agree you get your money refunded</li><li><strong><a target="_blank" href="http://skl.sh/16uu9JJ">Make your First Dollar</a>:</strong>&nbsp;a hyphenated course from above on Skillshare. &nbsp;Quick and Easy, but powerful.</li><li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307951529/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0307951529&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=iampla-20">The $100 Startup</a></li><li>Or the automating section of&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307465357/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0307465357&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=iampla-20">Four Hour Workweek</a>.</li></ol><p>You will learn how to test your ideas the right way&nbsp;<strong>before you waste money.&nbsp;</strong>You can send me a thank you card later.</p><p><strong>Do you want to start a blog or virtual site to promote yourself?</strong></p><p>Here are some great blogging platforms that require no coding knowledge (in the order I recommend):&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://wordpress.com/">wordpress.com</a>,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.weebly.com/">weebly</a>, and&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.squarespace.com/">squarespace</a>.</p><p><strong>Do you want to build and design websites for clients?</strong></p><p>The first question from here is what type of functionality are they going to need.</p><p>If it’s a basic site with just content and minimal functionality like a form then I recommend going with&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.weebly.com/">weebly</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.squarespace.com/">squarespace</a>&nbsp;and building the site.&nbsp; You can find plugins from 3rd&nbsp;party services and use weebly’s custom html and css boxes to add those plugins in.&nbsp; For example: for a form you can create one in wufoo and then add it in weebly.</p><p>If your client’s site is going to need more functionality (bells and whistles) then lets learn some CSS and HTML.&nbsp; More to come on that….</p><p><strong>Do you want to one day be able to build sites from scratch and/or move on to actual web application development?</strong></p><p>Well then…welcome to the fun stuff and obviously you will have to learn HTML and CSS.</p><p>So we begin...</p><p><strong>Our lovable project is going to be our first website</strong></p><p>Remember this is just your first site and you’re acquiring the skills of front-end web development in the fastest way possible.&nbsp; So you’re going to jump in over your head, take shortcuts, experiment, and create fast feedback loops (all of these ideas come from&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="ttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591845556/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1591845556&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=iampla-20">The First 20 Hours</a>).&nbsp; The cool thing is that web development is a perfect environment for all the above.</p><p><strong>A set of subskills</strong></p><p>Barebones front-end web development is composed of 3 subskills: design, css, and html.&nbsp; I won’t hit on design here,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.growhack.com/2013/04/04/the-minimal-homepage/">but less is more; design minimal</a>.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE April 2014:</strong> I've recently released my first online course <em>Learn To Build Your First Website In 1 Week</em>.  You can learn more <a href="https://www.udemy.com/build-your-first-website-in-1-week/" target="_blank">here</a>, but a quick synopsis is that I will take you from knowing absolutely nothing to having your first site up in less than a week's time. I'd love for you to take the course and when you sign up for my newsletter you receive free access to the course.</p>
