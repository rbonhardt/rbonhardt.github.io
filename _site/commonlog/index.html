His earliest essays were little more than compilations of these thoughts." I agree.</p>
		<h2>On Life</h2>
		<blockquote>Everyday should have some Novelty, Beauty, Growth, & Love. --Neville Medhora</blockquote>
		<blockquote>Think good and it will be good. --Rabbi M. M. Schneerson</blockquote>
		<blockquote>It's important to realize <strong>our time is limited on earth</strong>. --Noah Kagan</blockquote>
		<h2>On Following Your Passion</h2>
		<blockquote>Personally I’ve always made the most money when I created products, services or events that I loved and wanted to attend. When I reversed the equation and focused on how to make more money, it was always short-lived and not enjoyable. -- Noah Kagan</blockquote>
		<h2>On Goals</h2>
		<blockquote>“Thought is the sculptor who can create the person you want to be… In the long run, men hit only what they aim at.” --Henry David Thoreau, 19th century American naturalist and author</blockquote>
		<blockquote>“The world makes way for the man who knows where he is going.” -- Ralph Waldo Emerson</blockquote>
		<blockquote>“Give me a stock clerk with a goal and I’ll give you a man who will make history. Give me a man with no goals and I’ll give you a stock clerk.” -- JC Penny</blockquote>
		<blockquote>“First say to yourself what you would be; and then do what you have to do.” -- Epictetus</blockquote>
		<blockquote>“If one does not know to which port he is sailing, no wind is favorable.” -- Seneca</blockquote>
		<blockquote>“You got to be careful if you don’t know where you’re going, because you might not get there.” -- Yogi Berra</blockquote>
		<h2>On Patience</h2>
		<blockquote>Learning that sharpening the saw first, is one of the MOST important parts of cutting down a tree.  – Neville medhora</blockquote>
		<h2>On Play</h2>
		<blockquote>It should be noted that children at play are not playing about; their games should be seen as their most serious-minded activity. --Michele de Montaigne</blockquote>
		<h2>On Sales</h2>
		<blockquote>The next time you really want someone to understand, buy what you are selling or be convinced of your opinion figure out how you can show them vs tell them. – Noah Kagan</blockquote>
