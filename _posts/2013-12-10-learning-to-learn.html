<p class="lead"><blockquote><em>"I realized that becoming a master of karate was not about learning 4,000 moves but about doing just a handful of moves 4,000 times." <br>--&nbsp;Chet Holmes</em></blockquote></p><p>So you have this "new thing" you want to learn how to do. &nbsp;And you don't know how to learn it so you look on google and read some forums and you're overwhelmed with all the information. &nbsp;You have this mountain in front of you that you want to conquer and a confusing "road map" to do so.</p><!--more-->
<p>"Well let's get a better road map." &nbsp;You google and search Amazon for the best beginner guides or websites on the subject - in our case mountain. &nbsp;You then go out and buy one or a couple of the currently "cool and popular" learning materials or subscribe to one of the hip online courses on the subject. &nbsp;You dive in for a couple days, learning all the basics and eventually your initial excitement and motivation fizzles and you're left feeling like you have so much more to learn, you've achieved very little, and you stop. &nbsp;You repeat this process with the next "new skill" you want to learn.</p><p>Rinse and repeat until you don't want to rinse or repeat anymore.</p><p>"That's it I'll never learn something new."</p><p>[Enter my young naive self] "But Ryan that's stupid! &nbsp;If I was going to climb a mountain I'd just start climbing or I'd grab a guide and he'd take my giddy ass up the hill."</p><p>YESS EXACTLY!!!!</p><p>You wouldn't sit around eating twinkies staring at your impending mountain foe. &nbsp;YOU'D START SCALING THAT MOUNTAIN!!</p><p>If you hired a guide he wouldn't sit you down at&nbsp;base camp&nbsp;and take you through hours of hiking, fire building, and what ever other hiking related exercises you need. &nbsp;He'd get you trekking up the mountain and teach you as you go. &nbsp;And if he didn't then you'd move on to the next jolly bearded guide (yes all hikers are jolly and bearded and part hipster) down the road.</p><p>*NOTE* "Well Ryan actually if I were to scale [insert dangerous mountain] I'd want all those exercises and training before I took on that danger." We're NOT scaling everest here - remember we're beginning to learn how to climb mountains not achieving expert Sherpa status.</p><p>YOU didn't LEARN TO WALK by READING BOOKS. &nbsp;You tried multiple times, fell down, got back up, and eventually stumbled your diaper draped fat rolls of legs into the loving arms of your mom or dad. &nbsp;So when did we decide we need to dot all our I's and cross our T's before we learned a new skill or took on a new challenge?</p><p>My theory is we learned it somewhere along our 12+ years of education between the&nbsp;myriad&nbsp;of tests. &nbsp;We became so accustomed to making sure we knew everything and would get that A that we took that into all aspects of learning. (*NOTE* Acquire, don't just learn - read&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591845556/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1591845556&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=iampla-20">The First 20 Hours</a>&nbsp;for more on this).</p><p>Also, WE'RE SCARED OF FAILING - naturally. &nbsp;And the best way to make sure we don't fail (just like in school) is to make sure we have all the bases covered and know everything before even taking our first step. &nbsp;Or eventually not taking the first step at all. Sounds exhausting right? &nbsp;Well it is.</p><p>By learning all the principles before even trying you inherently stacks the odds against you:</p><p>1. We all only have so much excitement and motivation about a new subject until it runs out. &nbsp;And if you don't create wins and progress in the beginning, the two quickly dwindle. &nbsp;Think of &nbsp;a battery reloading.</p><p>2. By trying to "learn it all" in the beginning you are putting so much added pressure and exhaustion on yourself. &nbsp;You're only going to use about 20% on a regular basis of all the fundamentals you'll learn. &nbsp;Well what happens with the remaining 80%? It's intimidating you. &nbsp;It stays in the back of your mind and you constantly wonder when you're going to need to use it.</p><p>3.&nbsp;And by throwing the kitchen sink at yourself in the beginning you realize how little you actually know on the subject. &nbsp;We don't want to realize that till later when we can balance it with what we've already learned/done and how far we've come in our new venture. &nbsp;Ignorance is bliss - especially in the case of acquiring or learning a new skill.</p><p>So next time you are trying to learn something new or you're trying to teach a group of newbies here is my advice to you...wait for it...</p><p>JUUUUST DOOOOO ITTTTTT (props to Nike). &nbsp;Learn by doing. And here's some pointers along the way...</p><h3><strong>1. Come up with a project: Why are you or they learning it?&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>For me I'm currently learning web (mobile-view) application development. &nbsp;The reason I'm doing this is because I want to be able to build applications (quick lesson: facebook, twitter, hulu are&nbsp;<strong>web applications</strong>; your pizza restaurant down the street has a&nbsp;<strong>website</strong>). &nbsp;So my project is building my first web application. &nbsp;By having a project you have a gauge to judge your progress, you have an endpoint to strive for (always a key to accomplishing your goals) and you are working on something you care about - which all 3 will decrease your chances of giving up. Some examples of different projects for different skills:</p><p>Language learning - have a 10 minute conversation with a native speaker</p><p>Surfing - be able to get up and ride all the way in (or until you choose to bail) at least 3 times in a session.</p><p>Chess - getting ranked to a certain level. &nbsp;You can play on line to do this.</p><p>Musical instrument - learn to play a certain song. &nbsp;(<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOlDewpCfZQ">Axis of Awesome - so many songs with only 4 chords</a>)</p><h3>2. Buy, rent, or somehow get ahold of the 1-3 best sources on the subject: book, guide, video, website</h3><p>First you will need to skim these to see where to begin (and any tools you made need) and identify the most common terms/themes amongst them so that you know what you will need to revisit later as you learn. &nbsp;At this point start your project. &nbsp;The most ideal, and what I always look for, is for one of the guides to be along the lines of your project. &nbsp;For example if you were wanting to learn ruby on rails development there is&nbsp;<a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/">Hartl's Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a>&nbsp;in which he walks you through how to build a twitter-like application.</p><p>In other words find a guide or course that walks you through a project of its own. It will be similar enough and you'll learn enough in the process so that you can tweak that project to be your own. This creates early wins - you're actually creating something - and helps you maintain your excitement and interest in the subject. &nbsp;Progress</p><h3>3. When further reading is required or you're confused consult the other sources you grabbed</h3><p>When you're going through that guide or course there will be points where you might need some guidance, further reading on the topic, and/or have questions. &nbsp;This is when you return to the other guides or online sites to dig deeper about that certain subject or topic. &nbsp;Don't waste your time learning each topic until you need to. &nbsp;This eliminates a lot "learning and attentive time waste."</p><h3>4. Quantity over quality. &nbsp;Do it. Do it. And do it some more</h3><p>Learning by doing. &nbsp;At each new subskill, chapter, or roadblock you're going to want to analyze and cover all the basics. &nbsp;In other words you're going to want to make everything perfect - DON'T. &nbsp;Just do it. &nbsp;Go at it naively. &nbsp;Its quantity over quality. &nbsp;You make your code look better, the music sound crisper, the vase your shaping more perfect on your next try. &nbsp;You learn by doing.</p><p>In&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591845556/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1591845556&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=iampla-20">The First 20 Hours</a>&nbsp;Josh Kaufman tells a story about a pottery class that was split into 2 groups. &nbsp;One group was told that they'd be graded on how many pieces of pottery they made and the other half on how beautiful one piece was. &nbsp;The "quantity" group quickly set out making piece after piece. &nbsp;The "quality" group tried to create that perfect piece. &nbsp;Then when it was time at the end of the course for everyone to be graded consistently the most beautiful pieces of pottery belonged to pupils from "quality" group.</p><p>It's because they could only fail by not doing. &nbsp;As you continuously do something you develop and notice new subtleties that work and continue to refine your process. &nbsp;So don't be worried to fail. &nbsp;Don't aim to get it right the first time. &nbsp;Just do it. &nbsp;Fail miserably multiple times. &nbsp;Eventually you will succeed.</p><p><a href="http://www.writersstore.com/dont-break-the-chain-jerry-seinfeld/">Seinfeld practices this through his comedy-writing.</a></p><h2>TO-DO</h2><p>So go on. Do. Fail. Do. Roadblock. Find answer. Do. Fail. Learn. Succeed.</p><p>And enjoy it :)</p><p>P.S. What skill are you learning or teaching right now?</p>
