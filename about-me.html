          <blockquote>“I get up every morning determined to both change the world and have one hell of a good time.  Sometimes this makes planning my day difficult. – E. B. White"</blockquote>
          <p>During college I decided to avoid "Corporate America", work my dream jobs and live life as I wanted to. In the beginning it was rough and I STRUGGLED….but then I discovered simple tricks to promote myself and how to learn skills rapidly. Since then I’ve founded Maker-Based Education, helped found a non-profit running across the USA for Sarcoma cancer research, lived in 10 cities, been a white water river guide, surfed across Latin America, and advised multiple small businesses. My goal is to always love what I’m doing and do what I love - to learn something new and add value daily.</p>

          <p>At Maker-Based Education we aim to make it ridiculously easy and fun to learn coding.</p> 
          <p>Al of our courses follow a skill acquisition model where the students learn by doing as they work towards a clear cut goal that they achieve by completing a project. We don't believe in tests and subjective assessments, but creating things and objective measurements of learning.</p>

          <p><a href="http://www.miles2give.org" target="_blank">Miles 2 Give</a> is a 501c3 Non-Profit organization that raises funding for Sarcoma cancer research by running unprecedented team routes worldwide. We believe we are in a Generation Of A Cure. This 2013 tour our road team ran from San Francisco, CA to Ocean City, MD raising over $103,000 for research.  For the next tour we have partnered with Huntsman Cancer Institute to give them direct distribution for research of all funds raised and we will be aiming to raise $500,000 while running 10,000 miles counter-clockwise around the United State of America, from NYC to NYC.</p>
